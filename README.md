This is a simple and interactive console-based game built in Java as part of the CodeSoft Internship. The objective is to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. The game can be played across multiple rounds with score tracking included.

 Features
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100
- Accepts user guesses and provides real-time feedback:
- “Too high”
- “Too low”
- “Correct!”
- Limits the number of attempts per round (e.g., 5 tries)
- Option to play multiple rounds
- Tracks score across games
- Fully text-based interface with clear prompts

 How It Works
- The program generates a random number.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, a hint is given:
- Too high
- Too low
- Or Correct
- If the user guesses correctly or runs out of attempts, they’re asked if they want to play another round.
- The final score is displayed after quitting the game.
